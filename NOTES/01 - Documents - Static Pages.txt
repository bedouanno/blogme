***Static pages
The first we're going to do is to set up a controller to handle static pages.


!!! A controller is simply a class that helps delegate work. It is the glue of your web application.

***CONTROLLER
> Let's create a controller named Pages

root folder
 - application
	- controllers
		[create] - Pages.php
		
The code will be:

<?php
class Pages extends CI_Controller {

	public function view($page = 'home'){
		
	}
}

***VIEW
Once done created the Pages controller, let us now create view file:

application
	- views 
		-[create] templates folder
			-[create] header.php
			-[create] footer.php
			
header.php
footer.php

> Then let us create logic to the controller

- controllers
	- Pages.php
	
public function view($page = 'home')
{
        if ( ! file_exists(APPPATH.'views/pages/'.$page.'.php'))
        {
                // Whoops, we don't have a page for that!
                show_404();
        }

        $data['title'] = ucfirst($page); // Capitalize the first letter

        $this->load->view('templates/header', $data);
        $this->load->view('pages/'.$page, $data);
        $this->load->view('templates/footer', $data);
}

**** Routing
Open the routing file located at application/config/routes.php and add the following two lines. Remove all other code that sets any element in the $route array.

application
	- config
		-[open] routes.php

	$route['default_controller'] = 'pages/view';
	$route['(:any)'] = 'pages/view/$1';
	
if Error occour, we have to add htaccess file to root folder
[create].htaccess
	> add the code below:
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
	RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L]

***Configuration
application
	- config
		-[open] config.php
			> update base_url:
			$config['base_url'] = 'domain';
			
			> remove index.php:
			$config['index_page'] = 'index.php';
			
		
application
	- config
		-[open] autoload.php
			> add helper
			$autoload['helper'] = array('url','html','file','form');
